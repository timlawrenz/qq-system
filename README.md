# QuiverQuant (QQ) Performance Analysis Engine

This project is a Ruby on Rails API-only service designed to be the core performance analysis engine for the QuiverQuant automated trading project. Its primary purpose is to analyze the historical performance of a given trading strategy by processing a series of trades against historical market data.

The system fetches historical price data from the Alpaca Market Data API and implements a robust database caching layer to ensure speed and efficiency.

## Core Concept & Workflow

The fundamental goal of this service is to answer the question: **"How well did my algorithm perform over a specific period?"**

The workflow is as follows:

1.  **Submit Trades**: An algorithm (or a user) submits a list of trades (symbol, side, quantity, timestamp) to a dedicated API endpoint.
2.  **Initiate Analysis**: The system creates an `Analysis` record with a `pending` status and queues a background job to perform the calculations. This ensures the API responds quickly without blocking.
3.  **Fetch & Cache Data**: The background job determines the unique symbols and the date range required for the analysis. It intelligently fetches any missing historical price data from Alpaca's API and stores it in a local database cache (`HistoricalBar` table).
4.  **Calculate Performance**: The job processes the trades day-by-day against the cached historical data to generate a time series of the portfolio's value.
5.  **Generate Metrics**: From the portfolio value time series, the job calculates a comprehensive suite of performance metrics (e.g., Sharpe Ratio, Max Drawdown, Total P&L).
6.  **Store & Retrieve Results**: The calculated metrics are stored in the `Analysis` record, and its status is updated to `completed`. The user can then retrieve the results from a `GET` endpoint.

## System Architecture & Modular Design

The engine is built as a modular component within a Rails application, using **Packwerk** to enforce clear boundaries between different domains.

### Packs

*   **`packs/trading_strategies`**:
    *   **Responsibility**: Manages the `Algorithm` model and related business logic.
*   **`packs/trades`**:
    *   **Responsibility**: Manages the `Trade` model and its associated API endpoints and commands (`CreateTrade`, `UpdateTrade`, `DeleteTrade`).
*   **`packs/data_fetching`**:
    *   **Responsibility**: Manages the `HistoricalBar` cache model and all interactions with the external Alpaca Market Data API.
*   **`packs/performance_analysis`**:
    *   **Responsibility**: The core domain. Manages the `Analysis` model, the `InitiatePerformanceAnalysis` command, and the background job that orchestrates the analysis.

## Key Performance Metrics (KPMs)

The analysis engine calculates the following metrics:

*   Total Profit/Loss (P&L)
*   Annualized Return
*   Volatility (Annualized Standard Deviation)
*   Sharpe Ratio
*   Max Drawdown
*   Calmar Ratio
*   Win/Loss Ratio
*   Average Win vs. Average Loss

## API Endpoints

Business logic is encapsulated in `GLCommand` objects, which are called by the controllers.

*   `POST /api/v1/analyses`: Kicks off a new performance analysis.
*   `GET /api/v1/analyses/:id`: Retrieves the status and results of an analysis.
*   `POST /api/v1/algorithms/:algorithm_id/trades`: Creates a new trade for an algorithm.
*   `GET /api/v1/trades/:id`: Retrieves a specific trade.
*   `PUT/PATCH /api/v1/trades/:id`: Updates a trade.
*   `DELETE /api/v1/trades/:id`: Deletes a trade.

## Tech Stack

*   **Backend**: Ruby on Rails 7+ (API-only)
*   **Modularity**: `packs-rails` / `packwerk`
*   **Background Jobs**: `solid_queue`
*   **Testing**: `rspec-rails`
*   **External Services**: Alpaca Market Data API

### Running Tests

To run the full test suite:

```bash
bundle exec rspec
## Implemented Strategies

### 1. Simple Momentum Strategy

This is the initial proof-of-concept strategy implemented in the system. It is a momentum-based strategy that aims to align the portfolio with the recent purchasing activity of US Congress members.

#### Logic

On each day of the simulation, the strategy performs the following steps:

1.  **Signal Generation**: It queries for all "Purchase" transactions by congress members where the **transaction date** falls within the last 45 days. This 45-day window is significant as it aligns with the maximum time allowed for a member of congress to disclose a trade.
2.  **Portfolio Construction**: The strategy identifies the unique stock tickers from these recent purchases.
3.  **Equal Weighting**: It calculates an equal-weight target allocation for each ticker based on the total portfolio equity. For example, if 10 unique tickers are identified, each is allocated 10% of the portfolio's value.
4.  **Rebalancing**: The system then generates the necessary buy or sell orders to align the current portfolio with this new target.

It's important to note that this strategy is based on the **transaction date**, not the disclosure date. It operates on the hypothesis that stocks recently bought by insiders may have positive momentum.

#### Backtest Results

A backtest was conducted over a two-year period from late 2023 to late 2025. The key performance metrics are as follows:

*   **Total PnL**: **$2,766.65** (2.77% return on $100k initial capital)
*   **Win/Loss Ratio**: **3.1** (3.1 winning trades for every 1 losing trade)
*   **Max Drawdown**: **1.27%** (The largest portfolio decline was very small)
*   **Sharpe Ratio**: **-1.2579**

#### Interpretation

The results indicate that the "Simple Momentum Strategy" is a **low-risk, low-return** strategy.

*   **Pros**: It is consistently profitable, with a very high win rate and exceptionally low risk of significant losses (as shown by the low max drawdown and volatility).
*   **Cons**: The returns are modest. The negative Sharpe Ratio suggests that the returns, while positive, are lower than what one might expect from a risk-free investment.

This strategy serves as a solid baseline and a successful validation of the backtesting and analysis engine. Future work could focus on refining the signal generation or allocation logic to improve returns without substantially increasing risk.
