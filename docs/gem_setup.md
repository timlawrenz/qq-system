# Gem Setup Documentation

This document details the setup and configuration of the gems requested in issue #15.

## 1. packs-rails / packwerk

**Repository:** https://github.com/rubyatscale/packs-rails and https://github.com/Shopify/packwerk

**Setup completed:**
- Initialized packwerk with `bundle exec packwerk init`
- Generated `packwerk.yml` configuration file
- Created root `package.yml` file
- RSpec integration already configured in `.rspec` file with `--require packs/rails/rspec`

**Files created/modified:**
- `packwerk.yml` - Main packwerk configuration
- `package.yml` - Root package configuration
- `.rspec` - Already included packs-rails RSpec integration

**Usage:**
- Run `bundle exec packwerk check` to check for boundary violations
- Run `bundle exec packwerk validate` to validate configuration

## 2. solid_queue

**Repository:** https://github.com/rails/solid_queue/

**Setup completed:**
- Ran `bundle exec rails generate solid_queue:install`
- Configured as Active Job queue adapter for production environment
- Configured test adapter for test environment
- Configured solid_queue adapter for development environment
- Added queue database configuration

**Files created/modified:**
- `config/queue.yml` - SolidQueue configuration
- `config/recurring.yml` - Recurring jobs configuration
- `db/queue_schema.rb` - Database schema for queue tables
- `bin/jobs` - Executable for running queue workers
- `config/environments/production.rb` - Added solid_queue configuration
- `config/environments/development.rb` - Added solid_queue configuration
- `config/environments/test.rb` - Added test adapter configuration
- `config/database.yml` - Added queue database configuration

**Usage:**
- Run `bin/jobs` to start the queue worker
- Jobs are automatically processed using SolidQueue in production and development
- Tests use the test adapter (jobs are processed synchronously)

## 3. rspec-rails

**Repository:** https://github.com/rspec/rspec-rails

**Setup completed:**
- Ran `bundle exec rails generate rspec:install`
- Generated RSpec configuration files
- Created spec directory structure
- Added verification tests for the gem setup

**Files created/modified:**
- `spec/spec_helper.rb` - RSpec core configuration
- `spec/rails_helper.rb` - Rails-specific RSpec configuration
- `spec/setup_spec.rb` - Tests to verify gem setup is working
- `.rspec` - RSpec configuration (already existed with packs-rails integration)

**Usage:**
- Run `bundle exec rspec` to run all tests
- Run `bundle exec rspec spec/specific_spec.rb` to run specific tests

## Additional Setup

- Added missing `rubocop-capybara` gem to Gemfile to fix RuboCop configuration
- Made `bin/jobs` executable
- Created comprehensive tests to verify all gem setups are working correctly

## Verification

All setups can be verified by running:
```bash
bundle exec rspec spec/setup_spec.rb
```

This test verifies that all configuration files exist and are properly set up.
